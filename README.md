# Evaluating-the-degree-of-implementation-of-an-IT-project
  The management of an IT project consists in the process of planning, organizing and respecting the responsibilities in order to be able to complete the tasks proposed by the team, in an efficient and timely manner.
  The management of an IT project includes documentation on software development, hardware installations, network upgrades, business analysis and data management. In addition to normal problems in an IT project, which can cause bugs and ultimately errors, there are other negative factors that influence the execution of a project, such as: advancement of technology used during the project, infrastructure changes that have an impact on security and data management, but also dependent but unknown relationships between hardware, software, network infrastructure and data.
  Tasks are indispensable for a project of any type, and in an IT project they can be easily organized, with the help of theoretical notions. These notions are structured on the Jira application, specially intended for the management of an IT project.
  Epics are large parts of the project, which can be divided into smaller pieces (user stories), which represent the implementations and needs from the user's point of view .
An epic gives to development team everything they need to have a successful project: it gives them the opportunity to share big tasks. 
  A user-story is the smallest unit of "work" for the project; it is a well-defined purpose, expressed from the user's perspective. The purpose of a user-story is to articulate how the application / project will provide value / information to the client. 
  Hamming distance is used to compare two binary data strings. It is used to detect and correct errors in a computer project when data is transmitted over computer networks. It is also used in programming to compare two words of equal measure. In a set of strings of equal lengths, the minimum Hamming distance is the smallest possible distance between all pairs that can be formed with those strings in the set. 
  Project indicators are essential in the realization of any project. These refer to the values at the beginning of the implementation period, the values proposed at the end of the implementation period and the final values; are very useful in calculating the status of the project, the degree of implementation and other features of it. The indicators represent measurement instruments that make it possible to measure the level of achievement reached by the objectives proposed by the project, the activities achieved and the results obtained, as a result of its implementation. The identification and nomination of the indicators allow the control over the project realization process and
form the basis of the project monitoring and evaluation system. Project indicators fall into two categories:
• "output" indicators: measure the results of the project; can be
related both to the managerial part, to the calendar of activities;
• “result” indicators : measure the fulfillment of the project goal;
represent final tasks, which make up the final goal of the
project. 

SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE APPLICATION
First analysis (October 26, 2020 - November 17, 2020)
STRENGTHS
• The team has many project ideas that can be implemented. 
• The division of roles was exact and everyone knows what to do to make time more efficient. 
WEAK POINTS
• The schedule of the team members does not allow us to meet very often and to discuss all the problems that have arisen. 
OPPORTUNITIES 
• We found many theoretical documents about the planning and management of a project, as well as about the Hamming distance and the OOP principles we want to use. 
THREAT
• The information found is many and can lead to misunderstanding of the topic in the end or distance from the subject, so we must summarize our information very well
